Description: Occasionally when scraping web tables, data is collected as vectors.
    Instead of your 8x8 table being collected as a table, it is a 64 length vector.
    This package has one function, 'wrapit' that takes two inputs: 1) Character vector of column names and 2) Vector of data and returns the data frame that matches the table you web scraped.
